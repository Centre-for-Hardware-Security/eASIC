# TOTe (Tuneable Design Obfuscation Technique using eASIC)
This repository presents the obfuscation results which are generated by our custom tool TOTe (Tuneable Design Obfuscation Technique using eASIC). This tool is developed in the Centre for Hardware Security, Tallinn University of Technology (TalTech), Estonia to prevent the numerous security threats associated with CAD design flow. The repository consists of RTL, constraints and reports for the paper accepted in Asian Hardware Oriented Security and Trust Symposium (AsianHOST), Shanghai, P.R. China, December 16-18, 2021. The constraints files consist of force logic for actual timing analysis. Moreover, it also represents the bitstream of the obfuscated circuit. Obfuscation criteria are user-defined parameters to obfuscate the design intent and it generates the timing reports in three different formats (alphanumeric, cleaned timing report before and after obfuscation).
