# From FPGAs to Obfuscated eASICs: Design and SecurityTrade-offs
This repository presnts the obfuscation results which are generated by our custom tool TOTe (Tuneable Design Obfuscation Technique using eASIC). This tool is developeed in Centre for Hardware Security, Tallinn University of Technology (TalTech), Estonia to prevent the numerous security threats associated with CAD design flow. The repository consists of RTL, constratint and reports for the paper accepted in Asian Hardware Oriented Security and Trust Symposium (AsianHOST), Shanghai, P.R. China, December 16-18, 2021.
