# TOTe (Tuneable Design Obfuscation Technique using eASIC)
This repository presnts the obfuscation results which are generated by our custom tool TOTe (Tuneable Design Obfuscation Technique using eASIC). This tool is developeed in Centre for Hardware Security, Tallinn University of Technology (TalTech), Estonia to prevent the numerous security threats associated with CAD design flow. The repository consists of RTL, constratint and reports for the paper accepted in Asian Hardware Oriented Security and Trust Symposium (AsianHOST), Shanghai, P.R. China, December 16-18, 2021. The constraints files consists of force logic for acutal timing analysos. Moreover, it also represents the bistream of the obfuscated circuit. Obfuscation citeria is user defined paramters to obfuscate the design intent and it generates the timing reports in three different formats (alphanumeric, cleaned timing report before and after obfuscation).
